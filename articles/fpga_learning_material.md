Note that I'm currently biased towards VHDL -> Xilinx -> Vivado.

# Online sites

- [Hamsterworks.co.nz](http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) Very clear and easy to follow articles, tutorials and courses about FPGAs. Remember to [send him a postcard](http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/Module_20#Ready_to_carry_on.3F)!

- Have you wondered what AXI-stands for? Wonder no longer! [Mohammad Sadri](http://www.googoolia.com/wp/) has posted multiple [Youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/mamsadegh2/videos) about AXI-interface which is "industry standard interface/bus for communicating between HDL modules" (compare to [Wishbone interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbone_(computer_bus)) used mostly by [OpenCores](http://opencores.org/).

- Papilio board has series of [tutorials intended for Xilinx Spartan 6 + ISE users](http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Learning).

- Sven Andersson has written [multiple blog posts about](http://svenand.blogdrive.com/) ZedBoard, Microzed and other FPGA related issues. His style of writing is very step by step so the his posts are good very good for solving problems faced by beginners.

- [Adam Tailor's Microzed blog](http://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Xcell-Daily-Blog/Adam-Taylor-s-MicroZed-Chronicles-Part-37-Driving-Adafruit-RGB/ba-p/476332). Unfortunately I can not find good way to list all of the blog posts, or get the newest one.

# Books

- [Dave Vandenbout](http://www.xess.com/tutorials/) has written [FPGAs!? Now What?](http://www.xess.com/static/media/appnotes/FpgasNowWhatBook.pdf)-book which is suitable for those who are little bit impatient.

- [Free range VHDL](http://www.freerangefactory.org/site/pmwiki.php/Main/Books) (or [direct PDF download](http://www.freerangefactory.org/dl/free_range_vhdl.pdf)).
