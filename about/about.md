# About ...

## Who am I?

My name is Matti Jukola. I currently live somewhere in Europe and work remotely
as a development engineer for a Finnish company specializing at industrial image based measurement.
I have been working professionally with machine learning / computer vision / image
based measurement and data science since 2008. I spend most of my spare time coding,
learning, doing electronics, exercising and skydiving.

I'm currently searching for a new position related computer vision, machine learning or software development.

## Still Processing

Finally in 2014 I got
"Still Processing" blog up and running and converted few lectures, presentations
and other old things in to few small articles.

I'm planning on updating this blog infrequently by writing about things
that interest me or about things that I have learned. 
Fortunately for me, but unfortunately for this site
many of my interests are closely related to my work at my company and therefore outside of the
scope of this site because of NDA.
