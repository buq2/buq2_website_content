# About ...

## Who am I?

My name is Matti Jukola. I currently live in Tampere, Finland and work
as an development engineer at [Pixact Ltd](http://www.pixact.fi). I have been
working professionally with image processing / computer vision / image
based measurement since 2008. I spend most of my spare time coding,
learning, doing electronics and exercising.

## Still Processing

I should have started writing and contributing to OSS many years a
go but I prioritized other things. Finally in 2014 I got
"Still Processing" blog up and running and converted few lectures, presentations
and other old things in to few small articles.

I'm planning on updating this blog infrequently by writing about things
that interest me or about things that I have learned. 
Fortunately for me, but unfortunately for this site
many of my interests are closely related to my work and outside of the
scope of this site.
